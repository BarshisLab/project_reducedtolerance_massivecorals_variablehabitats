# project_reducedtolerance_massivecorals_variablehabitats
This repository contains protocols, data, and scripts to analyze growth and photophysiological responses to acute thermal stress of massive coral populations (*Porites lobata, Goniastrea retiformis*) transplanted into contrasting backreef environments of Ofu Island, American Samoa. Ramets of each species were transplanted from a Moderately Variable (MV) and Less Variable (LV) pool into the Highly Variable (HV) pool as well as back into native pool for one year. At six and twelve months, paired native and transplant ramets were exposed to acute heat stress assays to evaluate responses to thermal stress. In situ and NOAA Coral Reef Watch climate station temperature data was also collected during the study and compared to previous studies conducted in the Ofu Island backreef.
